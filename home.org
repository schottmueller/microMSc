* News
- The exercise class on December 21 will not be held in person due to health reasons. I will record several small screen casts (and upload them on this website) in which I discuss several exercises. If you have follow up questions on these screencasts, we will discuss those in our first exercise class in January. The lecture on Thursday December 22 will take place and will be held by Marius Gramb who will cover the rest of the auctions slides and possibly also one or two exercises).
  - Screencasts on exercises [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/MwvWL#cGBt8FG0QCGB_gL8B2pvQw][26c]], [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/fdeXk#JRJtgz-IuaK-hzgTr6T8Iw][27]], [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/e8WnF#-qH2_6NY_MhFYopm_fZ6Zg][28]] were added.
- The lecture on December 15 will be held as a [[https://uni-koeln.zoom.us/j/98247357978?pwd=aGF0WnhReXlOcVprdmhwVzRxY0xSdz09][zoom meeting]] online. (Meeting ID: 982 4735 7978; Password: 390800)  
- The exercise class on December 14 is canceled due to an illness.  
# - The website of the examination office contains the relevant information regarding the exam inspection.  
# - Exam results are published on KLIPS. The exam with solution hints is posted below.
# - Some information on the exam that was given in the last lecture:
 # - You are allowed to use calculators in the exam if these calculators (i) cannot store text, (ii) are not graphical and (iii) cannot solve equations for unknown variables. Put differently, your calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic of real numbers (addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and possibly also exponentiation, taking roots and logarithms as well as evaluating trigonometric functions) and nothing more. However, there is no need to have a calculator. Note that something like 3/41+5^2 is a perfectly valid answer.
#  - The exam consists of 2 or 3 exercises (which each may have 1-3 subquestions). Not finishing all exercises within 60 minutes is an option that should not scare you.  
# - In the last lecture (Feb. 4), I will only answer questions. We will not cover the Spence signaling model and this model will not be part of the exam (the binary signaling model, i.e. the pirate story, however is relevant for the exam). If you are interested in the Spence model, you can watch this [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/pnuTt#Ykzctmj2R-PkxcosnxLLmw][screencast]] I recorded last year.
# - There is no exercise session in week 1, i.e. we will start with the lecture on Thursday.
- To clarify: I do not use ILIAS (as I prefer openly accessible material and dislike parts of the terms of service) and all material for this course is available on this website.
- exam dates: Feb. 1, 2023, 8:15 (room: 101 Hörsaal XXIII 101/EG/17) and March 20, 2023, 10:00 (room: Aula 1); /registration via KLIPS/

* Course setup
  *Lecture:* Thursdays, 14:00-15:30 (101 Hörsaal XXIII 101/EG/17)
  
  *Exercise session:* Wednesdays, 8:00-9:30 (101 Hörsaal XXIII 101/EG/17)

  *Prerequisites:* You are expected to know basic game theory (normal form games, dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, game trees, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and microeconomics at Bachelor level (preferences, indifference curves, utility functions, consumer problem, Pareto efficiency). The  [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/M1vPF#qsgBnSpLwC1xwq2yNER_jA][schedule]] contains detailed prerequisites for each lecture in terms of economics and mathematics.
