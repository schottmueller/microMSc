* News
- The place of examination for the second exam date was changed to HS B.
- The [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/x11iTai5SSTkq4v][notes]] on game theory were updated to include (perfect) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Feedback on the notes is very welcome! (Password was announced in lecture.)
- [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/Dhwc7BvEnImkUKb][Notes]] on adverse selection are available. Feedback on the notes is welcome. (Password was announced in lecture.)
- The exercise session on Nov 15 will be taught online. See you university email account for details.
- Due to a public holiday, there is no exercise session on November 1. We will therefore not cover the exercises on markets and the fundamental theorem of welfare economics and continue with the exercises on decision making under uncertainty on November 8.
# - The exam inspection will be combined for both exam dates and  take place in April.
#  - Screencasts on exercises are on [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/urCdimezGeZTWDu][sciebo]].

# - The website of the examination office contains the relevant information regarding the exam inspection.  
# - Exam results are published on KLIPS. 
# - Some information on the exam that was given in the last lecture:
 # - You are allowed to use calculators in the exam if these calculators (i) cannot store text, (ii) are not graphical and (iii) cannot solve equations for unknown variables. Put differently, your calculator should be able to do basic arithmetic of real numbers (addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and possibly also exponentiation, taking roots and logarithms as well as evaluating trigonometric functions) and nothing more. However, there is no need to have a calculator. Note that something like 3/41+5^2 is a perfectly valid answer.
#  - The exam consists of 2 or 3 exercises (which each may have 1-3 subquestions). Not finishing all exercises within 60 minutes is an option that should not scare you.  
# - In the last lecture (Feb. 4), I will only answer questions. We will not cover the Spence signaling model and this model will not be part of the exam (the binary signaling model, i.e. the pirate story, however is relevant for the exam). If you are interested in the Spence model, you can watch this [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/pnuTt#Ykzctmj2R-PkxcosnxLLmw][screencast]] I recorded last year.

- To clarify: I do not use ILIAS because I prefer openly accessible material and dislike parts of the terms of service. All material for this course is available on this website.
- exam dates: Feb. 1, 2024, 14:15 (room: 101 Hörsaal XXIII 101/EG/17) and March 19, 2024, 12:00 (room: *HS B*); /registration via KLIPS/

* Course setup
  *Lecture:* Thursdays, 14:00-15:30 (101 Hörsaal XXIII 101/EG/17)
  
  *Exercise session:* Wednesdays, 8:00-9:30 (101 Hörsaal XXIV 101/EG/21)

  *Prerequisites:* You are expected to know basic game theory (normal form games, dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, game trees, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and microeconomics at Bachelor level (preferences, indifference curves, utility functions, consumer problem, Pareto efficiency). The  [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/M1vPF#qsgBnSpLwC1xwq2yNER_jA][schedule]] contains detailed prerequisites for each lecture in terms of economics and mathematics.

All materials are now also available on [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/urCdimezGeZTWDu][sciebo]].
