* Aggregating Preferences
** Motivation
   - people have different preferences 
   - how should societal decisions be taken?
     - navigate conflicts of preferences
     - respecting individual preferences
   - Examples:
     - political decisions and elections
     - a group of friends wants to go for drinks: how to aggregate the differing preferences over bars
     - aggregating votes of several judges in sports (boxing, figure skating etc.)
     - (expert) committees
     - a family deciding where to spend the summer holiday
     - ...

** Social choice theory
     - make ethical premises explicit
     - derive solutions consistent with these premises
     - normative (!)
** Example: Majority voting 
   - society ($N>2$ people) has to choose one of 2 alternatives/candidates ($x$ and $y$)
   - assumption for simplicity: everyone has a strict preference over alternatives
   - majority voting:
     - $x\succeq_S y$ if at least $N/2$ people prefer $x$ over $y$
     - $y\succeq_S x$ if at least $N/2$ people prefer $y$ over $x$
   - what normative premises underlie this /social welfare function/?
** Some criteria (for 2 alternatives)

*** Anonymity
    A social welfare function is /anonymous/ if the names of the agents do not matter, i.e. if a permutation of preferences across agents does not change the social preference.
    
*** Neutrality
    A social welfare function is /neutral/ if the names of the alternatives do not matter, i.e. the social preferences are reversed if we reverse the preferences of all agents.

*** Positive responsiveness
    A social welfare function is /positively responsive/ if the following holds: if one alternative $x$ is weakly socially preferred to $y$ although $y\succ_i x$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,N\}$, then $x$ is strictly socially preferred if we change $i$'s preferences (without changing anyone else's preferences).
   
** A first theorem
- didn't I claim that social choice starts with premises and then derives solutions?
   
*** May's Theorem
    If there are two alternatives, a social welfare function satisfies anonymity, neutrality and positive responsiveness if and only if it is majority voting. 
*** Proof sketch ("only if" for even $N$)
    - Anonymity: only number of people preferring alternative $x$ over $y$ matters for $\succeq_S$.
    - Neutrality: if $N/2$ people prefer $x$ over $y$ and $N/2$ prefer $y$ over $x$, then $x\approx_S y$.
    - Positive responsiveness: if more than $N/2$ people prefer $x$ over $y$, $x\succ_S y$ and vice versa.
** Majority voting with more than 2 alternatives
   - How to generalize majority voting with more than 2 alternatives?
*** Definition
An alternative $x$ is a /Condorcet winner/ if for any other alternative $y$ a majority prefers $x$ over $y$.

*** Example
    A group of students want to tell the teacher their preferences over exam forms (open book, closed book, online exam). How to aggregate the preferences?
  |          | best | middle | worst |
  | /       | <    |        |       |
  |----------+------+--------+-------|
  | Student 1 | ob | oe    | cb   |
  | Student 2 | oe  | cb    | ob |
  | Student 3 | cb  | ob  | oe   |
Which alternative is Condorcet winner?
# things are harder; we will have to be a bit more serious and to do so we have to be precise about the model and the premises we desire!

* Formal model and criteria
  
** Model
   - finite set $X=\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_K\}$ of alternatives
   - $N\geq 2$ agents, each has a complete and transitive preference relation over $X$
*** Social preference relation
    A social preference relation is a complete and transitive preference relation on the set $X$.
*** Social welfare function 
    A social welfare function assigns to each profile of preferences $(\succeq_1,\succeq_2,\dots,\succeq_N)$ a social preference relation $\succeq_S$.

** Examples: social welfare function
   Are the following social welfare functions desirable?
   - The preferences of agent 1 are the social preferences: $\succeq_S (\succeq_1,\succeq_2,\dots,\succeq_N)=\succeq_1$
   - Fixed social preference relation: $\succeq_S (\succeq_1,\succeq_2,\dots,\succeq_N)=x_1\succ_S x_2\succ_S x_3\succ_S\dots\succ_S x_K$
   - Borda Count:
     - turn every agent's preference order into points: the $k$ most preferred alternative receives $k$ points
     - for every alternative, sum the points it gets from all agents
     - order alternatives according to points (less points are better)
**  Borda and Olympic Ice Skating  competition I
   - judging in sports is similar to our problem
     - aggregation of several judges' rankings
   - final 2002 Olympic figure skating competition
     - Slutskaya is the last skater to perform
     - at that moment: 1. Kwan, 2. Hughes, 3. ...
     - Slutskaya is doing well but not super and ends up second
     - who came first? who came third?

**  Borda and Olympic Ice Skating  competition II
   - table contains the ranks that the 7 judges assign to the three skaters 
   |         | Kwan | Hughes | Slutskaya |
   | /       |    < |        |           |
   |---------+------+--------+-----------|
   | judge 1 |    2 |      3 |         1 |
   | judge 2 |    2 |      3 |         1 |
   | judge 3 |    1 |      2 |         3 |
   | judge 4 |    1 |      2 |         3 |
   | judge 5 |    3 |      1 |         2 |
   | judge 6 |    3 |      1 |         2 |
   | judge 7 |    3 |      1 |         2 |
   |---------+------+--------+-----------|
   | Points  |      |        |           |

** Minimal (?) normative criteria
*** Weak Pareto principle (unanimity) 
    If $x\succ_i y$ for all $i=1,2,\dots,N$, then $x\succ_S y$.
*** Non-dictatorship
    There is no individual $i$ such that $x\succeq_S y$ if and only if $x\succeq_i y$. (no matter what other agents' preferences are)
*** Independence of irrelevant alternatives
    Take two profiles of preferences $(\succeq_1,\succeq_2,\dots,\succeq_N)$ and $(\succeq_1',\succeq_2',\dots,\succeq_N')$. If for every agent $i$ the ranking of $x$ and $y$ is the same under $\succeq_i$ and $\succeq_i'$, then the social ranking of $x$ and $y$ must be the same under these two preference profiles.\footnote{More formally, let the two preference profiles be such that for all agents $i$ $x\succeq_i y$ if and only if $x\succeq_i' y$. Then $x\succeq_S y$ if and only if $x \succeq_S' y$.}
   
* Arrow's  impossibility theorem
** Arrow's impossibility theorem
*** Theorem
Let there be at least 3 alternatives in $X$. There exists no social welfare function that satisfies all 3 criteria (weak Pareto principle, non-dictatorship and independence of irrelevant alternatives).

Proof is somewhat lengthy (see textbook)
** Consequences  of Arrow's theorem
   - no social welfare function satisfies even minimal criteria
   - we have to give up even some of these minimal criteria if we want to proceed!
   - some ways to proceed:
     - pick only one alternative: no complete social ordering necessary
       - leads to similar result
     - domain restriction
       - we implicitly assumed that all preference profiles were possible (in the definition "social welfare function")
       - more positive results if we can rule out certain preferences
     - cardinal utility
       - we only looked at orderings not at intensity of preference
       - assuming that there is something like intensity of preferences /and this intensity is comparable across agents/ helps to aggregate preferences but is a questionable assumption
* Domain restrictions
** Domain restriction: Single peaked preferences I
- imagine alternatives are ordered on the real line: $x_1<x_2<\dots <x_K$   
- assumptions:
  - common ordering of alternatives
  - everyone has a most preferred alternative 
  - of two "too high" (or "too low") alternatives, an agent prefers the one closer to his most preferred alternative
  - for simplicity: odd number $N$ of agents

- more precisely:
  - each agent $i$ has a most preferred alternative $x^*(i)\in\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_K\}$
  - if $x_k,x_m>x^*(i)$, then $x_k\succ_i x_m$ if and only if $x_k<x_m$
  - if $x_k,x_m<x^*(i)$, then $x_k\succ_i x_m$ if and only if $x_k>x_m$
- if we represent preferences by utility function, this function is "single peaked"
** Domain restriction: Single peaked preferences II
*** Median agent for single peaked preferences
    An agent $i$ is a /median agent/ if\linebreak (i) there are at least $N/2$ agents with most preferred alternatives weakly above $x^*(i)$ and\linebreak (ii) there are at least $N/2$ agents with most preferred alternatives weakly below $x^*(i)$.
*** :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:

Note: a median agent always exists.
** Domain restriction: Single peaked preferences II
*** Proposition
Let preferences be single peaked and $i$ be a median agent, then $x^*(i)$ is a Condorcet winner.
*** Proof
  - Consider a pairwise majority vote between $x^*(i)$ and $x_m>x^*(i)$.
    # - As $i$ is a median there are at least $N/2$ agents with peak less or equal to $x^*(i)$.
    # - As $N$ is odd and $i$ is median, there is a strict majority of agents with peak less or equal to $x^*(i)$.
    # - For all agents with peak weakly below $x^*(i)$, single peakedness implies $x^*(i)\succ_i x_m$
    \vspace*{1.5cm}
  - Consider a pairwise majority vote between $x^*(i)$ and $x_m<x^*(i)$.
    # - As $i$ is a median there are at least $N/2$ agents with peak higher or equal to $x^*(i)$.
    # - As $N$ is odd and $i$ is median, there is a strict majority of agents with peak higher or equal to $x^*(i)$.
    # - For all agents with peak weakly higher $x^*(i)$, single peakedness implies $x^*(i)\succ_i x_m$
    \vspace*{1.5cm}
** Domain restriction: Single peaked preferences III
   - consider pairwise majority voting between arbitrary alternatives, i.e. say $x_k$ is socially preferred to $x_m$ if $x_k$ wins in a majority vote over $x_k$ and $x_m$
*** Proposition
    If preferences are single peaked, pairwise majority voting induces a social welfare function.
*** :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
*** Proof
    to show: resulting preferences are complete and transitive
     - As $N$ is odd and preferences are strict, pairwise majority voting yields a strict winner between any two alternatives.\linebreak
      $\Rightarrow$ social preference ordering resulting from pairwise majority voting is complete and strict. 
     - Transitivity: let $x_m\succ_S x_k$ and $x_k\succ_S x_l$ \dots
    #   - Preferences over $X'=\{x_m,x_k,x_l\}$ only are still single peaked and therefore a Condorcet winner over the elements of $X'$ exists in $X'$.
    #   - as $x_k$ and $x_l$ cannot be Condorcet winners by $x_m\succ_S x_k$ and $x_k\succ_S x_l$, $x_m$ is the Condorcet winner
    #   - hence, $x_m\succ_S x_l$, i.e. transitivity holds

* Cardinal utility
** Cardinal utility I
   Reminder:
*** Representation by a utility function
    A complete preference relation $\succeq$ over a set $X$ is represented by the utility function $u:X\rightarrow\Re$ if and only if
    $$x\succeq y \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad u(x)\geq u(y).$$
    If $u$ represents $\succeq$, then $\psi(u)$ also represents $\succeq$ where $\psi:\Re\rightarrow\Re$ is an arbitrary strictly increasing function.

** Cardinal utility II
  - suppose we have 2 agents and $x\succ_1 y$ while $y\succ_2 x$
  - we choose utility functions for the two agents
    - $u_1(x)=3$, $u_1(y)=1$
    - $u_2(x)=0$, $u_2(y)=1$
  - which alternative should society prefer?
# indifference or the one with higher sum of utilities, choose another utility function representing the same preferences and show that "utilitarian" choice reverses
** Cardinal utility II
   - if we assign meaning to utility, social welfare function is not invariant to strictly monotone transformations
     # more social welfare functions become feasible
   - allows to get around Arrow's impossibility theorem
   - problem: choice of specific agent utility functions implicitly makes normative judgments beyond our criteria
   - for now:
     - accept some given utility functions $u$
     - let welfare depend on the utilities of the agents and be represented by a function $W:\Re^N\rightarrow\Re$ that aggregates agent utilities into "welfare"
       - we abuse notation and call $W$ also "social welfare function" 
     - what are reasonable choices for $W$? what normative judgments are expressed by the choice of $W$?
** Cardinal utility III
*** Pareto dominance   
    Alternative $x$ is /Pareto dominated/ by alternative $y$ if and only if $y\succeq_i x$ for all agents $i=1,..,N$ and $y\succ_i x$ for at least one agent.
*** Pareto efficiency
    An alternative $x$ is /Pareto efficient/ if there is no alternative $y$ that Pareto dominates $x$. 
# insert example
** Cardinal utility IV
*** Pareto criterion and $W$
    Pareto dominating alternatives are socially preferred to the alternatives they dominate if social welfare function $W$ is such that $W(u)>W(u')$ for any two vectors $u=(u_1, u_2,\dots,u_N)$ and $u'=(u_1',\dots,u_N')$ with $u_i\geq u_i'$ for all $i=1,\dots N$ and strict inequality for at least one $i$.
*** :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:

note: *weak* Pareto criterion is satisfied if $W$ is such that for any two vectors $u=(u_1, u_2,\dots,u_N)$ and $u'=(u_1',\dots,u_N')$ such that *$u_i>u_i'$* for all $i=1,\dots N$, we have $W(u)>W(u')$.
    
** Cardinal utility V: Rawlsian welfare
   $$W_{Rawls}(u_1,\dots,u_N)=\min[u_1,\dots,u_N]$$

  - $W_{Rawls}$ satisfies weak Pareto criterion
  - $W_{Rawls}$ is anonymous
  - $W_{Rawls}$ is "utility level invariant":
    - social preferences remain the same if we transform all agent's utility using /the same/ strictly increasing transformation
  - $W_{Rawls}$ satisfies "Hammond Equity":
    - take two utility vectors $(\bar u_1,\bar u_2,\dots,\bar u_N)$ and $(\hat u_1,\hat u_2,\dots,\hat u_N)$ and suppose $\bar u_i=\hat u_i$ for all $i$ except $j$ and $k$
    - suppose further $\bar u_j<\hat u_j<\hat u_k<\bar u_k$
    - Hammond equity states that then $W(\hat u)> W(\bar u)$
** Cardinal utility VI: Rawlsian welfare
*** Proposition
    An increasing and continuous social welfare function $W$ satisfies Hammond equality and the weak Pareto principle if and only if it can take the Rawlsian form $W_{Rawls}(u_1,\dots,u_N)=\min[u_1,\dots,u_N]$.
*** :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:

    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading

    :END:
- $\approx$ Rawlsian welfare is equivalent to weak Pareto criterion  + Hammond equity 
*** Proof      
see Jehle and Reny (2011), section 6.3.1

** Cardinal utility VII: Utilitarian welfare
   $$W_{ut}(u_1,\dots,u_N)=\sum_{i=1}^N u_i$$
- most common form of welfare function (sometimes with individual weights)
- $W_{ut}$ is strictly increasing $\Rightarrow$ satisfies Pareto criterion
- $W_{ut}$ is anonymous (not true if weights are used)
- $W_{ut}$ is "utility-difference invariant"
  - social preferences are the same if we transform all agents utility using the transformation $\psi_i(u_i)=a_i+b u_i$

** Cardinal utility VIII: Utilitarian welfare
*** Proposition
    A strictly increasing and continuous social welfare function $W$ satisfies anonymity and utility-difference invariance if and only if it can take the utilitarian form $W_{ut}=\sum_{i=1}^N u_i$.
*** Proof
see Jehle and Reny (2011), section 6.3.2
** Cardinal utility IX: the veil of ignorance I
 - thought experiment  
   - you will be one of the agents in society
   - you have to decide which alternative to choose
   - you do not know which agent you are going to be
   - some people have argued that whatever a "fair-minded" person would choose in this hypothetical situation is a good societal decision
** Cardinal utility X: the veil of ignorance II
   - Harsanyi:
     - my chance of being agent $i$ is $1/N$
     - my choice should maximizes the expected utility $\sum_{i=1}^N (1/N) u_i(x)$
     - $\rightarrow$ utilitarian welfare
   - Rawls:
     - I do not know who I am going to be and there is no basis for assigning probabilities.
     - risk aversion implies maximizing the worst case utility
     - $\rightarrow$ Rawlsian welfare
       
   - Arrow:
     - Rawls makes a mistake as he assumes not risk aversion but /infinite/ risk aversion, i.e. risk aversion does /not/ imply maximizing worst case utility.
       
* Manipulability
** Manipulability I
   - so far: preferences of all players are known
   - problem: aggregation
   - what if everyone knows his preferences privately?
     - ask for preferences
     - aggregate
   - additional problem: gaming the system by misreporting preferences!
   - result due to Gibbard and Satterthwaite:\linebreak
    /If there are at least three alternatives and a social welfare function is (i) Pareto efficient and (ii) creates no gaming possibilities, then it is dictatorial./

** Manipulability II
   - one example for manipulability
     
*** Example:   Borda count
  
    |         | most preferred | middle preferred | least preferred |
    | /       | <              |                  |                 |
    |---------+----------------+------------------+-----------------|
    | Agent 1 | x              | y                | z               |
    | Agent 2 | y              | x                | z               |
    | Agent 3 | y              | x                | z               |
    |---------+----------------+------------------+-----------------|
    | Points  |                |                  |                 |
    Could agent 1 manipulate the social preference relation by misrepresenting his own preferences? Would he want to do so?
