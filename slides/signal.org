** Leeson's story I
   - pirates
     - completely outside the law
     - hanged when caught
     - adopted policy: victims are left alive if they surrender and are killed if they (initially) fought/fled
   - commissioned ships
     - commissioned to plunder other countries' ships
     - more treated like prisoners of war (not hanged!) when caught
     - lose this status if (i) kill surrendering prisoners or (ii) use a pirate flag ("jolly roger")
   - pirates rarely had to fight as most merchants surrendered upon seeing jolly roger
   - commissioned ships met more opposition

** Leeson's story II
   - important features to make this an "equilibrium"?
     - pirates and commissioned ships have same preferences over merchants behavior
     - merchants prefer different behavior against pirates and commissioned ships 
     - using jolly roger is more costly for commissioned ships
     
** Pirate model
timing:  
   1. nature chooses attacker type: Pirate (P) with prob $p$ , commissioned (C) with $1-p$
   2. attacker chooses between Jolly Roger (J) and other flag (F)
   3. defender decides whether to surrender (s) or fight (f)

Payoffs:
|           | Pirate (J or F) | commissioned (F) | commissioned (J) |
| /         | <               |                  |                  |
|-----------+-----------------+------------------+------------------|
| surrender | -1,3            | -1,3             |  -1,3-X          |
| fight     | -3,1            | 0,1              | 0,1-X            |


** Pirate analysis
|           | Pirate (J or F) | commissioned (F) | commissioned (J) |
| /         | <               |                  |                  |
|-----------+-----------------+------------------+------------------|
| surrender | -1,3            | -1,3             |  -1,3-X          |
| fight     | -3,1            | 0,1              | 0,1-X            |



- if $X\geq 2$, then "separating" equilibrium:
   - P play J
   - C play F
   - defenders surrender iff J is played and fights otherwise

- "pooling" equilibrium
   - P and C play F
   - defender always surrenders (fights) if $p\geq 1/3$ ($p\leq 1/3$)

* Spence job market signaling
** Job market signaling
- worker has type $\theta\in\{\theta_l,\theta_h\}$ with $\theta_h>\theta_l>0$
  - interpret $\theta$ as productivity/ability
- worker chooses education level $e$ at cost $c(e,\theta )$ with  - education is costly: $c_e>0$
  - marginal costs are increasing: $c_{ee}>0$
  - no education has no costs: $c(0,\theta)=0$
  - higher $\theta$ (productivity/ability) implies lower marginal costs: $c_{e\theta }<0$
- competitive market offers wage equal to expected productivity $\theta$
- information
  - $\theta$ is worker's private information
  - market views $\theta$ (ex ante) as being $\theta _h$ with probability $\lambda\in(0,1)$
  - market might infer $\theta$ from education choice (and therefore update initial belief from $\lambda$)
- payoff worker: $w-c(e,\theta)$

** 2 Model interpretations
either
- 1 worker with privately known $\theta$
- mass 1 of workers with share $\lambda$ of $\theta_h$ types
- competitive market: either many homogenous firms or at least two firms in Bertrand competition on the labor market
- note: education does not change productivity in this model, i.e. no positive welfare effect!
  - extreme assumption to focus entirely on signaling aspect! 

** equilibrium in job market signaling
- market belief $\mu(e)$:
  - the probability that $\theta=\theta_h$ if education level $e$ is observed
- worker's strategy optimal given belief $\mu$
- market belief $\mu(e)$ derived by Bayes rule whenever $e$ is in the support of one of the types' strategy
- off equilibrium path choices of $e$:
  - some arbitrary $\mu(e)\in[0,1]$

\vspace*{0.5cm}
- note: wage with education level $e$, i.e. $w(e)$, equals $\mu(e)\theta_h+(1-\mu(e))\theta_l$

** Preliminaries
-  $\theta _h$ has flatter indifference curve than $\theta_l$ ("single crossing")
- wage $w(e) \in[\theta_l,\theta_h]$

** Separating equilibria I
- separating: two types have different education choices

In a separating equilibrium, $w(e(\theta_l))=\theta_l$ and $w(e(\theta_h))=\theta_h$. Furthermore, $e(\theta_l)=0$.

** Welfare
- what is equilibrium without signaling possibility?
- who is better/worse off due to signaling possibility?
# note depending on $\lambda$ and $c$, even high types can be worse off in separating; e.g. if $\lambda$ is sufficiently high and E[\theta] therefore close to \theta_h


** Refinements I
- multiplicity of equilibria supported by off path beliefs that can be freely chosen
- are these beliefs reasonable?

\node[right] at (0.99,0.7){$w(e)$};
\end{tikzpicture}

** Refinements II

- let $e_l$ be the equilibrium education of type $\theta_l$
- let $\tilde e$ be the education level such that $\theta_l$ is indifferent between his equilibrium payoff and $(w,e)= (\theta_h,\tilde e)$
  $$w(e_l)-c(e_l,\theta_l)=\theta_h-c(\tilde e),\theta_l)$$
   
- equilibrium refinement: $\mu(e)$ equals 1 for all $e>\tilde{e}$

*** Lemma
The only equilibrium satisfying the equilibrium refinement is the "least cost separating equilibrium", i.e. the separating equilibrium in which $e(\theta_h)=\tilde e$.

- note: $\tilde e$ in separating equilibrium satisfies
$$\theta_l=\theta_h-c(\tilde e,\theta_l)$$
- note: $\tilde e$ in pooling equilibrium satisfies
$$\mathbb{E}[\theta]-c(e^*,\theta_l)=\theta_h-c(\tilde e,\theta_l)$$

** income tax
- assume least cost separating equilibrium
- suppose a revenue neutral income tax is introduced
  - wage of $\theta_l$ is subsidized by $s>0$
  - wage of $\theta_h$ is taxed by amount $t=\frac{1-\lambda}{\lambda}s$

** mechanics of signaling summarized
- both types prefer higher wage (and less education)
- market is willing to pay higher wage to high types
- education is (marginally) more costly for lower type
  - wage increase $\theta_h-\theta_l$ is more than cost of education for high type
  - wage increase $\theta_h-\theta_l$ is less than cost of education for low type
- high types can signal their high type by obtaining education


** can you think of examples for signaling in practice?
   # Mafia and face-tatoos or killing someone to become a member
   # it takes a Nixon to go to China (or a Schr√∂der to reform unemployment insurance)
