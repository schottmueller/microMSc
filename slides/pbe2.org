* Introduction
** Introduction
   - previous lecture: market can breakdown if only sellers know product attributes
   - possible countermeasure: try to demonstrate good quality (independent tests etc.)
     - /dynamic/ games of incomplete information
       - dynamic: players take (partially observed) actions sequentially
     - new solution concepts
       - with complete information: dynamics \rightarrow /subgame perfect/ Nash equilibrium (SPNE)
       - with incomplete information: dynamics \rightarrow /perfect/ Bayesian Nash equilibrium
   - we introduce the equilibrium concept with simpler examples this time and return to the motivation later

* Subgame perfect Nash equilibria

** Subgame perfect NE and empty threats I
- (slightly distressed) mum to 6-year old ``On the count of 3, you are going to put your jacket on, or I will leave without you!''

\end{figure}

** Subgame perfect NE and empty threats III
- subgame: part of a game tree that is itself a game tree
  - subgame starts at a decision node of the original game
  - all decisions and payoffs following this node are part of the subgame
  - subgame must not cut through information sets
- how many subgames do we have in our parent-child example?
- note: every game is subgame of itself!
*** Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
A strategy profile that induces a Nash equilibrium in every subgame is called
"subgame perfect Nash equilibrium".

** Subgame perfect NE and empty threats IV
- which equilibium is (not) subgame perfect in our example game?
- backwards induction
  - start at the bottom of the game tree (terminal decisions)
  - determine payoff maximizing choice
  - substitute terminal decisions with the payoffs resulting from payoff maximizing choice
  - repeat

* Sequential rationality
** Sequential rationality I
- threat is still not credible but subgame perfection has no bite!
- sequential rationality: each player maximizes expected payoff at every information set
  - player has a belief at information set
  - player anticipates later choices of other players
  - player computes expected payoff following each of his choices using the belief and anticipated choices
- determine sequentially rational choice of Parent!

** Sequential rationality II
- /system of beliefs:/ one belief for each information set, i.e. a probability distribution over nodes in the information set
- /assessment:/ a strategy profile and a system of beliefs

*** Sequential rationality
  An assessment consisting of a profile of strategies $s$ and a system of beliefs $\mu$ is called \emph{sequentially rational} if the following holds for every player $i\in I$ and every information set $\mathcal{I}$ at which player $i$ has to act:\linebreak
Strategy $s_i$ maximizes the expected payoff of player $i$ at information set $\mathcal{I}$ taking belief $\mu_{\mathcal{I}}$ and the strategies at all other information sets as given.

:END:

- which assessments are sequentially rational in our example game?

* Consistency
** Consistency
- which beliefs are reasonable?
  - "equilibrium": anticipating strategies of other players $\Rightarrow$ beliefs should be consistent with strategies!
*** Consistency
 An assessment $(s,\mu)$ is consistent if the beliefs $\mu$ are determined from the strategies $s$ using Bayes' rule wherever possible.

:END:
- which sequentially rational assessment is consistent in our example game?
\begin{equation*}\hspace*{-0.7cm}
  Prob[j.\;off| j.\;off\text{ or }j.\;off+bite]=\frac{Prob[jacket\;off]}{Prob[jacket\;off]+Prob[jacket\;off+bite]} 
\end{equation*}

* Perfect Bayesian equilibrium
**  Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE)
***  Perfect Bayesian equilibrium
  A \emph{perfect Bayesian equilibrium} is an assessment that satisfies sequential rationality and consistency.

:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
:END:

- main solution concept for games of imperfect/incomplete information
  - recall Harsanyi's trick: games of incomplete information can be transformed into games of imperfect information
- aside:
  - some authors call the concept "weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium" and use "perfect Bayesian equilibrium" to refer to assessments that also satisfy some additional conditions

* Examples    
    
** Donut game I
- Amelia has a donut and decides whether to offer it to Bilal
- Bilal can accept or reject
- donut might be cream-filled or mustard-filled (Amelia likes pranks!)
- Amelia knows the filling, Bilal does not
- Bilal considers both fillings equally likely
- payoffs as on next slide

** Donut game  II

\istb{reject}[r]{(-1,0)}
\endist
\istroot(4)(2-1)<right>{$1-q$}
\istb{accept}[l]{(3,-1)}
\istb{reject}[r]{(-1,0)}
\endist
\xtInfoset(3)(4){Bilal}
\end{istgame}
\end{figure}

** Donut game III
- strategy to determine PBE
  - guess a strategy for Amelia
  - which beliefs are consistent with the strategy?
  - what is Bilal's best response with these beliefs?
  - is Amelia's initial strategy a best response to this?
- which pure strategies does Amelia have?

** Classification of PBE in games of incomplete information
- types of equilibria according to what can be learned from the choices:
  - /pooling/ equilibrium: all types of one player make the same choice
    - other players cannot infer type from choice
  - /separating/ equilibrium: each type uses a different action
    - other players perfectly infer type from choice
  - /partially pooling/separating:/ some but not all types use the same action
    - choice contains some but not perfect information about type
