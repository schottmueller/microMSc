* Pencils and prices

** No one knows how to make a pencil I[fn:: The origin of this example is L.E. Reed's essay "I, Pencil" (1958).]

- wood, graphite, metal, rubber, paint, glue all produced by different people using various inputs, tools methods and techniques
- transport, assembly
- thousands of people in dozens of countries have been involved in the production of one pencil
- no person/office/company planned or coordinated the whole process
- most of them did probably not know they were involved in pencil making
- no single person would be able to make a pencil!
  
** No one knows how to make a pencil II
- what do the people involved in production know?
# own capabilities, resources, preferences and PRICES; prices reflect net-demand/scarcity of the outside world  


** Prices I
- prices
  - reveal, 
  - transmit,
  - and aggregate information
     
- how do prices work?
  # scarcity increases prices, abundance decreases (seller realize they cannot sell at high prices or that they might get away with charging higher prices)

- how well can this work economywide?
  # (complex system with complementarities and substitutabilities between all kind of products)
  - necessary to accurately reflect opportunity costs/benefits!
  
** Prices II
- consumer problem of consumer $j$:
  $$\max_{x_1^i,\dots,x_n^i} u_i(x_1^i,\dots,x_n^i)\qquad s.t.:\sum_{j=1}^n x^{i}_{j} p_j\leq m^i$$
  $$\Rightarrow MRS_{km}^i=-\frac{p_k}{p_m}$$
- at the optimal consumption bundle, each consumer's MRS between goods $k$ and $m$ is the same (and equal to price ratio)
- identical MRS is a necessary condition for efficiency 
- can we find a price system that clears all markets, i.e. can there be prices such that all demands are just satisfied?

** Walrasian equilibrium and the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics

*** Result
If markets are complete, then there exists a Walrasian equilibrium, i.e. a price vector such that all markets are cleared. The equilibrium allocation is Pareto efficient.

- with complete markets, the decentralized price mechanism leads to an efficient outcome although
  - no one knows more than his own preferences and endowment
  - $\Rightarrow$ no one would be able to compute an efficient outcome
  - $\Rightarrow$ centralized planning is unable to reach efficiency
- with complete markets, the dispersion of information is unproblematic as prices can steer everyone's behavior in the right direction 


** First fundamental  theorem of welfare economics: important (implicit) assumptions
     - all agents are price takers
     - complete markets
       - every good that matters for some consumer is traded on its own market
       - guaranteed property rights, i.e. voluntary trade is possible (no theft etc.)
     - note:
       - assumptions are sufficient to reach efficiency
       - an efficient equilibrium may still exist if some of the assumptions fail!
	 
	 
** Violations of assumptions
   - agents are price takers
     - examples of cases where agents are not price takers?
       \vspace*{1cm}
       # patents and other legal monopolies, economies of scale leading to monopolies; 
   - complete markets assumption
     - a good is not traded on a market:
       \vspace*{1cm}
       # pollution, clean air, silence
     - distinct goods are traded on a common market:
       \vspace*{1cm}
       # consumers cannot distinguish different qualities etc.
** The scope for policy: efficiency arguments
   - policy within model:
     - guarantee property rights + enforce contracts
     - efficiency reached without policy intervention given complete market assumption
   - failure of assumptions is necessary but not sufficient for existence of efficiency enhancing policy
     - outcome may still be efficient
     - efficiency enhancing policy may not be available
	 # (informational requirements etc.)
   - reactions if assumptions fail that are motivated by model
     - competition policy and sector regulation
	 # force big players to act a bit more like price takers
     - complete/create the market
	 # emission trading, regulation: enforce product standards that clearly define the market where otherwise markets would be lumped together (e.g. poisonous cucumbers and non-poisonous ones) , create property rights (e.g. for reasonable silence)
   - what is the effect of information dispersion in incomplete markets? 
     - "information economics": we will deal with some specific such settings and problems in the coming weeks (more in course "Information and Strategy")
       	 
** Aside: policy interventions into the price system
   - say the equilibrium price of goods $j$ and $k$ are $p_j^*$ and $p_k^*$ but a government forces the prices to be $\bar p_m$ and $\bar p_k$ such that $\bar p_m / \bar p_k < p_m^*/p_k^*$ \linebreak (for simplicity think of $\bar p_k=p^*_k$ and $\bar p_m < p^*_m$)
     - what are the effects of such a policy?
       # starting from eq prices for other goods: excess demand for good $j$ but also effects on other goods (unless Cobb Douglas prefs) -> unclear who will get how much of good j -> rationing of  j -> unlikely that those with highest WTP for j get more -> inefficiency
     - give examples for similar interventions in practice
       # housing prices -> excess demand: hard to find a flat, price controls in war times for food, gasoline etc. (usually accompanied explicit rationing schemes/vouchers)
       - what are the effects of these policies?
       - how are these policies motivated?
	# often distributional motivations -> are prices really the right tool? 
       # notes to self: only one price fixing does not work in the model as 1 degree of freedom;   

   
** Aside: The scope for policy: distributional arguments
   - second fundamental theorem of welfare economics:\linebreak
     any efficient allocation is a Walrasian equilibrium for some vector of initial endowments
   - implication
     - realize distributional objectives by redistributing endowments only
     - then let market ensure efficiency
   - some caveats to this
     # redistribution as such is typically not costless; dynamics and dynamic incentives

* Exchange economy

** A standard exchange economy
   - $I$ consumers
   - $n$ goods
   - consumer $i$ has initial endowment $e^i=(e_1^i,e_2^i,\dots,e_n^i)$ where $e^i_j\in\Re_+$
     - assumption: each good exists in strictly positive quantities, $\sum_{i=1}^Ie_j^i>0$ for all $j=1,\dots,n$
   - consumers preferences over consumption are represented by a utility function $u^i:\Re_+^n\rightarrow\Re$
     - assumption: $u^i$ is strictly increasing in each component
     - assumption: $u^i$ is strictly quasi-concave
     - assumption: $u^i$ is continuous
   - consumers can exchange endowments
     - who should/will eventually consume what?
** Notation
   - $e=(e^1,e^2,\dots, e^I)$ is the vector of endowments
   - allocations are denoted by $x=(x^1,x^2,\dots ,x^I)$
     - $x^i\in \Re^n_+$ is agent $i$'s allocation of the $n$ goods
   - feasible allocations:
     $$F(e)=\{x|\sum_{i=1}^Ix^i=\sum_{i=1}^Ie^i\}$$
     where each $x^i\in\Re^n_+$
       
** Efficiency
   
*** Pareto efficiency
    An allocation $x\in F(e)$ is Pareto efficient if there is no $y\in F(e)$ such that $u^i(y^i)\geq u^i(x^i)$ for all $i=1,\dots,I$ with strict inequality for at least one $i$.

    
** Comparison
   - does Arrow's impossibility theorem apply in this framework?
   # - cardinal utility
   # - only preferences over own conumption -> not universal domain

** Prices and the consumer problem
   - $p=(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ be a vector of prices ($p_j$ is the price of good  $j$) and assume $p_j>0$ for all $j=1,\dots,n$
   - assumption: each consumer takes the vector of prices as given  
   - consumer $i$'s problem:
     $$\max_{x^i\in\Re^n_+}u^i(x^i)\qquad s.t.:\quad \sum_{j=1}^np_jx_j^i\leq  \sum_{j=1}^np_je_j^i$$
   - think of $m^i(p)=\sum_{j=1}^np_je_j^i$ as consumer $i$'s income
#   - given our assumptions, what can we say about the solution of this problem?
   - given our assumptions a unique solution $x^i(p,m^i(p))$ exists and this function is continuous in $p$

# ** Solution to the consumer problem
#  - solution exists
    # as feasible set is compact and objective continuous 
#  - solution is unique
    # as $u^i$ is strictly quasi-concavity of
    # -> unique solution (graphically: strictly convex insidifference curves and linear budget constraint)
#  - denote the solution to the consumer problem as $x^i(p,m^i(p))$
#  -  $x^i(p,m^i(p))$ is continuous
    # (in the interior of $\Re^n$) by unique solution and continuity of u^i and the constraint ("theorem of the maximum")
#  - demand is homogenous: $x^i(p,m^i(p))=x^i(\lambda p,m^i(\lambda p))$
    # as $\lambda$ does not change objective or feasible set
#  - budget constraint holds with equality
    # as $u^i$ is strictly increasing in each component and $p_j>0$ for all $j$
#  - the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods equals the price ratio
#    $$MRS_{j,k}^i=-\frac{\partial u^i/\partial x^i_j}{\partial u^i/\partial x^i_k}= -\frac{p_j}{p_k}$$
    # by foc of Lagrangian
   
** Excess demand
   - aggregate excess demand for good $j$ is defined as
     $$z_j(p)=\sum_{i=1}^Ix_j^i(p,m^i(p))-\sum_{i=1}^Ie^i_j$$
     
     - if $z_j(p)>0$ demand for good $j$ is higher than its supply at price $p$
     - if $z_j(p)<0$ demand for good $j$ is lower than its supply at price $p$       
   - aggregate excess demand is defined as
     $$z(p)=(z_1(p),z_2(p),\dots,z_n(p))$$  

# ** Properties of excess demand
# *** Proposition
#    Under our assumptions, excess demand satisfies
#    - continuity: $z$ is continuous at $p$
#    - homogeneity: $z(\lambda p)=p$ for all $\lambda\in\Re_{++}$
#    - Walras' law: $\sum_{j=1}^n p_j z_j(p)=0$
# *** Proof
#    - continuity:
#      # sum of continuous functions is continuous
#    - homogeneity:
#      # as all x^i_j are homogenous, so is their sum
#    - Walras law:
#      $\sum_{j=1}^n p_j z_j(p)=\sum_{j=1}^n p_j \left( \sum_{i=1}^Ix_j^i(p,m^i(p))-\sum_{i=1}^Ie^i_j  \right)$
#      $= \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^n\left( p_j x_j^i(p,m^i(p))-p_je^i_j\right)$
#      $= \sum_{i=1}^I\left[ \sum_{j=1}^n\left( p_j x_j^i(p,m^i(p))\right)-m^i(p) \right]=0$ as budget constraint of each consumer holds with equality
      

# ** Implications of Walras' law
#    - suppose we have only 2 goods ($n=2$) and we have at price vector $p$ excess demand in market 1, $z_1(p)<0$
#     - what can we say about market 2?
       # excess supply of "equal value" in market 2
#   - let $n>2$, if we have excess demand in good 1, $z_1(p)<0$, what can we say about other markets?
     # excess demand in market 1 is balanced by excess supply of equal value in other markets
#   - if $n-1$ markets have zero excess demand, i.e. $z_j(p)=0$ for $j=1,\dots,n-1$, what can we say about the remaining market?
     # also zero excess demand

** Walrasian equilibrium
*** Definition: Walrasian equilibrium
    A vector $p^* \in \Re^n_{++}$ is called a Walrasian equilibrium if $z(p^*)=0$.

    :END:
 
    - all market demands connected
    - "general equilibrium"

** Walrasian equilibrium: Existence  
*** Existence theorem   
    A Walrasian equilibrium $p^*$ exists. 
*** Proof existence theorem
    somewhat technical, see Jehle and Reny (2011), ch. 5.2.1
** Walrasian equilibrium: Efficiency    
*** First fundamental theorem of welfare economics
    Let $p^*$ be a Walrasian equilibrium. The equilibrium allocation $x^*=(x^1(p^*),x^2(p^*),\dots,x^I(p^* ))$ is Pareto efficient.
** Proof of the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics:
   \vspace*{-0.25cm}
    - Suppose, to the contrary, that $y=(y^1,\dots,y^I)$ Pareto dominates $x^*$.
      - Then, $\sum_{j=1}^n p^*_j y_j^i\geq m^i(p^*)$ for all $i$ with strict inequality for at least one $i$ (Why?)
	\vspace*{-0.1cm}
	# by strict quasiconcavity of u^i, the consumer problem has a unique solution -> as y^i is at least a good as this solution...it must be infeasible or coinices with the solution
	$$\Rightarrow \sum^I_{i=1} \sum_{j=1}^n p^*_j y_j^i>\sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^n p^*_je^i_j$$
      - $y$ must be feasible:
	$$\sum_{i=1}^I y^i\leq\sum_{i=1}^I e^i$$
	\footnotesize{(note: there are vectors on both sides of the inequality!)}
      - hence, $p^* \cdot \sum_{i=1}^I y^i \leq p^* \cdot \sum_{i=1}^I e^i$ as all $p^*_j>0$ \footnotesize{(note: this is a dot/vector product)}
	\vspace*{-0.25cm}$$\Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^n p^*_j y_j^i\leq \sum_{i=1}^I \sum_{j=1}^n p^*_j e^i_j \qquad \qed$$
